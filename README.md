# üìå InnovaGraphics  

**InnovaGraphics** is an interactive, gamified learning platform for studying computer graphics.  
It combines **theory, practice, and multiplayer battles** into a single web app, making the learning process both **engaging and effective**.  

Created as a collaborative project for a university contest, the platform allows users to:  
- Explore topics in computer graphics.  
- Learn theory in a structured and user-friendly format.  
- Practice skills directly in the web app.

## üé• Demo
This project was created as a team effort for a university competition.  

‚ö†Ô∏è *Note:* The project requires complex database and additional frontend configuration.  
Since my main contribution was backend development, I provide:  
- Full **source code** in this repository (for proof of authorship).  
- A **demo presentation video** that demonstrates all the main features of the app.
